      "supporting_points": [
        "(1) **Margin Expansion Risks**: AAPL's gross margin expanded to 46.3% in Q2 2024 (vs. 44.3% YoY), but this was driven by **services growth (22% YoY) and cost cuts**, not iPhone pricing power. Hardware margins are under pressure from **weaker China demand (iPhone revenue -8% YoY in Q2)** and rising component costs (e.g., OLED displays). If services growth slows (currently 20%+ of revenue), margins could revert to ~44%, compressing EPS by ~5-7%.",
        "(2) **Decelerating Revenue Growth**: AAPL's Q2 revenue grew just **1.5% YoY (vs. 2.5% in Q1)**, with iPhone revenue flat YoY. Guidance for Q3 implies **low-single-digit growth**, below the 5-year avg of 7%. The **lack of a clear growth catalyst** (e.g., no new iPhone cycle until Sept 2024) and **saturation in smartphones** (global shipments -5% YoY in 2023) suggest revenue growth may stagnate near 2-3% in FY2025, below the 5%+ priced into the stock.",
        "(3) **Valuation Premium Looks Stretched**: AAPL trades at **30.5x forward P/E (vs. 5-year avg of 24x)** and **8.2x forward P/S (vs. 6.5x avg)**, a **25-30% premium** to its historical range. The PEG ratio is **2.5x (vs. 1.5x for peers like MSFT)**, implying growth is **overpriced**. If EPS growth slows to 5% (vs. 12% in FY2024), the P/E could compress to 25x, implying **~18% downside** from current levels.",
        "(4) **Macro and Regulatory Headwinds**: AAPL faces **three key risks**: (a) **China exposure** (20% of revenue) is threatened by geopolitical tensions (e.g., U.S. export bans on AI chips) and local competition (Huawei's Mate 60 Pro gained 6% market share in Q1 2024); (b) **rising interest rates** hurt discretionary spending (iPhone ASPs fell 1% YoY in Q2); and (c) **antitrust lawsuits** (DOJ sued AAPL in March 2024 over App Store monopoly) could force costly changes to its ecosystem, eroding services margins (currently 70%+)."
